# Button

A Lua function made in the [TIC-80 fantasy console](https://tic80.com/) that creates buttons that interact with the mouse.

These buttons have an (x, y) position, booleans that check if they are pressing or were released, and a sprite pair for the above cases. Besides this, they have updating and rendering functions.
